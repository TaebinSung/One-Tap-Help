# One-Tap Help (Hackathon MVP)

A simple home-care / assisted-living “one tap” request system with 3 roles:

- Patient: sends requests (Water / Help / Emergency)
- Caretaker: can go ON SHIFT, accept and complete requests
- Guardian: always sees requests and can accept/complete as fallback

MVP uses **one Expo app** + **Firebase Firestore realtime listeners** (no push notifications yet).
